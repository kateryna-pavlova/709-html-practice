    <p class="about__text">London is a unique place, with a particular vibe and special atmosphere. Every corner is worth exploring and appreciating, and we know how to approach the beauty of the city.
Our guides and founders were born in London, they know the city as the back of a hand, and are happy to share the experience with you. We believe that the best way to understand the city is to explore it like a local, without unnecessary crowds and pomp. If you think the same, we should explore the city together.</p>
